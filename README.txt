Version: 1.0.0
Date: 11-09-2020
IDE: IntelliJ Community Edition 2020.01
JDK: Java SE 13.0.1
JavaFX: JavaFX-SDK-15

How to Run:

In IntelliJ, Set your VM options to `--module-path /Users/ben/Documents/javafx-sdk-15/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml`.
You should have to install the following libraries: JavaFX-SDK-15 and MySQL Connector. After these are installed, you can run the main function.


In Reports, I have decided to categorize the appointments by location. This grabs the number of appointments that have
the same location.

The program will automatically be translated to French when the user changes their location and language to France.
